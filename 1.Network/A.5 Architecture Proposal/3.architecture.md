## Overview

This document presents Meridian FinServe's network architecture in three stages:

| S.No | Stage | What it shows |
|------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | **Before** | Network as-is — how Meridian existed before any incident analysis |
| 2 | **PCAP Analysis** | What the packet capture revealed — the attack chain, IOCs, frame evidence |
| 3 | **After** | Proposed hardened architecture — every control mapped to a PCAP finding |

> **The diff between Before and After is the deliverable.**
> The PCAP analysis is the evidence that justifies every change.

---

## 1. BEFORE — Network As-Is (Pre-Analysis)

> This diagram shows Meridian FinServe's network **as it stood before the incident was investigated** — a normal corporate topology with no known compromise. No attack labels. No findings. Just the architecture as Meridian's IT team would have drawn it.
>
> 📄 **Standalone file:** [before.mermaid](./before.mermaid)

**Key structural weaknesses visible even before analysis:**
- Single perimeter firewall — no layered defence
- Flat subnet — all internal hosts reachable from each other
- No east-west segmentation between workstations and servers
- Single log server with no centralised SIEM
- Branch offices connecting directly via VPN to HQ firewall

---

## 2. PCAP ANALYSIS — What the Capture Revealed

> Running the PCAP through Wireshark and tshark revealed a complete Trickbot + Cobalt Strike intrusion chain. The timeline below shows what happened, in order, with frame evidence.

**Capture window:** `2021-05-26 20:23:18 → 21:43:28 UTC` (80 min 9 sec · 26,644 frames)
**Internal domain:** `victorypunk.com`
**Infected workstation:** `DESKTOP-OG16DGY` · `10.5.26.132`
**Domain Controller:** `VICTORYPUNK-DC` · `10.5.26.4`

## 3. AFTER — Proposed Hardened Architecture

> Every control below is directly motivated by a finding from the PCAP analysis above.
> This is not a generic security checklist — it is a point-by-point response to what the capture revealed.
>
> 📄 **Standalone file:** [after.mermaid](./after.mermaid)

| S.No | Control Added | Fixes | PCAP Evidence |
|------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Egress allowlist — ports 80/443 only | Port 447 exfiltration channel | IOC: port 447 used for `antivirusupdaty.com` |
| 2 | Block C2 IPs at perimeter | C2 beaconing | IOCs: 5 confirmed C2 IPs |
| 3 | DNS Firewall | Secondary C2 domain + IP recon services | `antivirusupdaty.com` · frames 818, 10962, 14878 |
| 4 | VLAN 10/20/30 segmentation | Flat subnet lateral movement | Frame 10799 `svcctl` workstation → DC |
| 5 | East-west default-deny firewall | Direct SMB workstation → DC | 2,164 SMB packets workstation → DC |
| 6 | Jump host only path VLAN30→VLAN20 | Unrestricted internal access | All 5 other hosts reachable from workstation |
| 7 | MFA + PAM | No privileged access controls | DC compromised, LSASS dumped |
| 8 | Suricata — ~202s TLS beacon rule | C2 beaconing went undetected 80 min | H1 confirmed ~202s interval |
| 9 | Zeek + SIEM — svcctl alert | Lateral movement went undetected | Frame 10799 |
| 10 | SIEM — POST to external IP alert | Data exfiltration went undetected | Frames 2910, 13210 |
| 11 | CloudTrail + VPC Flow Logs | Cloud footprint dark | No visibility on AWS activity |

---

## Risk Reduction Summary

| S.No | Threat | Before | After | PCAP Evidence |
|------|--------|--------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | C2 beaconing | Undetected for 80 min | Blocked at perimeter + SIEM alert < 5 min | 28 TLS sessions · ~202s intervals |
| 2 | Lateral movement | Unrestricted SMB workstation → DC | East-west firewall blocks svcctl | Frame 10799 |
| 3 | Data exfiltration | Port 447 open · no alert | Port 447 blocked · SIEM POST alert | Frames 2910, 13210 |
| 4 | IP recon | ipify/ipinfo/myexternalip unrestricted | DNS firewall blocks all three | Frames 818, 10962, 14878 |
| 5 | DC compromise | DC on flat subnet with workstations | DC isolated in VLAN 20 | 5 other hosts also targeted |
| 6 | Detection time | ~80 minutes blind | Target < 5 minutes | No NDR/SIEM in before state |

---

## Implementation Effort

| S.No | Control | Effort | Trade-off |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Egress allowlist + IP blocklist | **S** — days | May break legacy tools using non-standard ports |
| 2 | DNS Firewall | **S** — days | Overzealous rules can block legitimate lookups |
| 3 | Suricata + Zeek rules | **M** — weeks | Requires tuning to reduce false positives |
| 4 | SIEM pipeline | **M** — weeks | Ongoing alert fatigue management needed |
| 5 | VLAN 10/20/30 segmentation | **L** — months | Significant re-IP and switch reconfiguration |
| 6 | East-west firewall | **L** — months | Application teams must map all legitimate flows |
| 7 | MFA + PAM | **M** — weeks | User friction on privileged account workflows |
| 8 | Jump host | **M** — weeks | Adds one-hop latency for all admin access |

> **S** = Days (config change) · **M** = Weeks (tool deployment) · **L** = Months (architectural change)

--- 

## Implementation Roadmap

> Controls ordered by **severity first, then effort**. The highest-severity controls — those that directly stop active C2, exfiltration, and lateral movement — start on **Week 1 (May 15)**. Architectural changes that require re-IP and switch work follow in Phase 3.

### Severity & effort key

| S.No | Rating | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **CRITICAL** | Directly blocks a confirmed active attack vector from the PCAP |
| 2 | **HIGH** | Adds detection/prevention that would have caught the attack within 5 min |
| 3 | **MEDIUM** | Architectural hardening that removes entire attack surface categories |
| 4 | **S** (days) | Config change only — single maintenance window |
| 5 | **M** (weeks) | Tool deployment + tuning |
| 6 | **L** (months) | Architectural change requiring re-IP, regression testing, change freeze |

---

### Phase 1 — Quick wins · Week 1–2 (May 15–May 28)

*CRITICAL severity · effort S (days) · start immediately*

| S.No | Control | Severity | Effort | Starts | Duration | Fixes (PCAP) | MITRE | Trade-off |
|------|---------|----------|--------|--------|----------|--------------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Block 5 C2 IPs at perimeter | **CRITICAL** | S | Week 1 | 2 days | 28 TLS sessions · frames 791–26451 | T1071.001 · T1041 | Attacker rotates IPs — maintain blocklist with threat feed |
| 2 | Egress allowlist ports 80/443 · block port 447 | **CRITICAL** | S | Week 1 | 3 days | Port 447 exfil channel · antivirusupdaty.com | T1041 · T1048 | Audit legacy tools using non-standard ports before enforcing |
| 3 | DNS Firewall — block C2 domain + IP recon services | **CRITICAL** | S | Week 2 | 3 days | antivirusupdaty.com · api.ipify.org · ipinfo.io · myexternalip.com | T1568 · T1016 | Start blocklist-only — no sinkhole until tuned |

---

### Phase 2 — Tool deployments · Week 3–8 (May 29–July 9)

*HIGH severity · effort M (weeks)*

| S.No | Control | Severity | Effort | Starts | Duration | Fixes (PCAP) | MITRE | Trade-off |
|------|---------|----------|--------|--------|----------|--------------|-------|-----------|
| 4 | Suricata IDS — beacon · svcctl · exfil rules | **HIGH** | M | Week 3 | 4 weeks | C2 undetected 80 min · frame 10799 | T1071.001 · T1021.002 · T1041 | 1 week post-deploy for FP tuning — test rules on PCAP first |
| 5 | Zeek + SIEM pipeline — conn · DNS · SMB logs | **HIGH** | M | Week 4 | 5 weeks | Lateral movement undetected · frames 2910, 13210 | T1021.002 · T1041 · T1003 | Define triage runbook before go-live to prevent alert fatigue |
| 6 | MFA + PAM for privileged accounts | **HIGH** | M | Week 5 | 4 weeks | DC compromised · LSASS dumped · frame 23758 | T1003 · T1078 | Phased rollout — admins first, then all staff · 8h session timeout |

---

### Phase 3 — Architectural changes · Week 9–20 (July 10–Oct 1)

*MEDIUM severity · effort L (months) · cannot be rushed — requires re-IP and regression testing*

| S.No | Control | Severity | Effort | Starts | Duration | Fixes (PCAP) | MITRE | Trade-off |
|------|---------|----------|--------|--------|----------|--------------|-------|-----------|
| 7 | VLAN 10/20/30 segmentation — DMZ · Servers · Endpoints | **MEDIUM** | L | Week 9 | 8 weeks | Flat subnet — frame 10799 workstation → DC · all 5 hosts reachable | T1021.002 · T1543 | Significant re-IP + switch reconfig · full flow audit required per VLAN |
| 8 | East-west firewall + jump host (VLAN30 → VLAN20 only) | **MEDIUM** | L | Week 13 | 8 weeks | 2,164 SMB packets workstation → DC · direct svcctl cross-VLAN | T1021.002 | All admin flows rerouted through jump host · adds one-hop latency |

### Why this order?

| S.No | Reason | Controls |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | The 5 C2 IPs and port 447 are **known, confirmed IOCs** — blocking them stops an *active* attack pattern with zero architecture changes | 1, 2 |
| 2 | DNS Firewall eliminates the IP recon loop (api.ipify.org → ipinfo.io → myexternalip.com) that precedes every exfiltration event in the PCAP | 3 |
| 3 | Suricata/Zeek/SIEM turn the 80-minute blind spot into a < 5-minute alert — needed before VLAN work begins so there is visibility during the re-IP window | 4, 5 |
| 4 | MFA/PAM closes the privilege escalation path that let the DC get dumped | 6 |
| 5 | VLAN segmentation + east-west firewall are the most impactful long-term controls but require change freezes and cannot be rushed — sequenced last to avoid re-doing network design after tool deployments | 7, 8 |
