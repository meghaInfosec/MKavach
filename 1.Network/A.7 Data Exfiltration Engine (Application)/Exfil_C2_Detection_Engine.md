# EXFIL / C2 Detection Engine

## Overview
This script analyzes a PCAP file to detect **Command & Control (C2)** beaconing and **Data Exfiltration** activity, with special focus on patterns commonly seen in Cobalt Strike, Trickbot, and similar threats.

---

## What This Code Does (Key Features)

### 1. **Input Processing**
- Takes a PCAP file as input (via CLI or default path)
- Uses `tshark` to extract relevant protocol fields (HTTP, DNS, SMB, DCERPC, TLS, NTLM)
- Robust CSV parsing with proper quoting

### 2. **Signal Detection (Per-Packet)**
- **DNS Tunneling**: High entropy + long query names
- **HTTP Activity**: Uploads (POST/PUT), potential beacons
- **TLS Visibility**: ClientHello + SNI extraction
- **Lateral Movement**: SMB admin/IPC shares, DCERPC execution, NTLM auth
- **File Activity**: Upload indicators

### 3. **Flow Aggregation**
- Groups traffic into directional flows `(src → dst)`
- Tracks total bytes + **internal → external** bytes only (true exfil metric)
- Collects timestamps and DNS queries per flow

### 4. **Behavioral Analysis**
- **Beacon Detection**: Low jitter (regular inter-arrival times) using Coefficient of Variation
- **DNS Tunneling Confirmation**: Aggregate entropy + length across multiple queries
- Promotes weak signals to strong ones when combined (e.g., HTTP + regularity = confirmed beacon)

### 5. **Pivot Host Detection (v5/v6 Highlight)**
- Identifies hosts that:
  1. Show **external C2 signals** (beaconing, upload, DNS tunnel, etc.)
  2. Perform **lateral movement** to multiple internal hosts (SMB/DCERPC)
- This is the classic "beacon-in → spread-out" pattern

### 6. **Risk Scoring Engine**
- Weighted scoring based on signals
- Volume bonus for large exfil
- Direction bonus (internal → external)
- **Pivot bonus** (+25) for flows involving pivot hosts
- Final score capped at 100

### 7. **Output & Visualization**
- Detailed classification of flows (High / Suspicious / Normal)
- Top internal data senders
- Network graph (`networkx` + `matplotlib`) with pivot hosts highlighted in red
- Saves graph as PNG

## Usage

```bash
python Exfil_C2_v6.py <pcap_file> [--min-peers 3] [--output graph.png]
```

### Example
```bash
python Exfil_C2_v6.py "2021-05-26-Trickbot-infection-with-Cobalt-Strike.pcap"
```

---

## Dependencies
- `tshark` (Wireshark)
- Python packages: `pandas`, `networkx`, `matplotlib`, `ipaddress`

---

## Strengths
- Excellent for **Cobalt Strike / Trickbot** style infections
- Strong pivot host logic
- Directional exfil focus
- Good statistical beacon detection

## Limitations (2026 perspective)
- Limited visibility into heavily encrypted modern C2 (HTTP/2, custom protocols)
- Can be extended with JA3 fingerprints, flow statistics, etc.
