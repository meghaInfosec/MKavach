# Hacking OWASP Juice Shop: Forged Review (Broken Access Control)

**Author:** Team-09 
**Category:** A01:2021 — Broken Access Control  
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐ Medium  
**Target:** OWASP Juice Shop (localhost:3000)

---

## Introduction

This lab — **Forged Review** — challenges us to *"Post a product review as another user or edit any user's existing review."*

This is a classic example of one of the most critical web application vulnerabilities:  
**A01:2021 — Broken Access Control**, which allows attackers to perform actions they shouldn't be authorized to do.

---

## Step 1: Understanding the Target Feature

First, we need to understand how the review system works. As a logged-in user, we can navigate to any product and leave a review.

**We start by logging into our own account and finding a product, like the "Carrot Juice".**

![Step 1 - Navigate to Carrot Juice product page and login](./Evidences/1.JPG)

---

**Next, we write and submit a simple review.**

![Step 2 - Write and submit a review on the product](./Evidences/2.JPG)

---

This helps us understand the normal process. After submitting, our review appears alongside others — this is the **expected behavior**.

## Step 2: Intercepting the Request with Burp Suite

To find a flaw, we need to look at what's happening behind the scenes. We'll use **Burp Suite** to intercept the request sent when we submit a review.

![Step 4 - Burp Suite proxy setup and interception](./Evidences/4.JPG)

---

**With Burp Suite's proxy enabled, we submit another review.**

By examining the HTTP history in Burp, we find the `PUT` request sent to the `/rest/products/{id}/reviews` endpoint.

> This is the request that creates the review.

---

## Step 3: Manipulating the Request to Impersonate Another User

Here's where the vulnerability lies. The body of the `PUT` request contains the review message and an **"author"** field.

> **The application trusts the user-provided author email instead of verifying it against the user's session.**

We can exploit this by changing the `author` field to another user's email. We find another user's email from the existing reviews — for example: `uvogin@juice-sh.op`

**We modify the body of the request in Burp Repeater, changing the "author" to our target's email.**

![Step 6 - Burp Repeater with modified author field](./Evidences/6.JPG)

### The Modified JSON Body Looks Like This:

```json
{
  "message": "This is a forged review!",
  "author": "uvogin@juice-sh.op"
}
```

![Step 7 - Modified JSON body in Burp Repeater](./Evidences/7.JPG)

---

## Step 4: Verifying the Exploit

Now let's check the product page to see if our attack worked.

**Refreshing the "Carrot Juice" page, we can see our forged review — but now it appears to have been posted by the user we impersonated.**

![Step 8 - Forged review appearing under victim's name on product page](./Evidences/8.JPG)

**Success! The application notifies us that we've solved the "Forged Review" challenge.**

## Conclusion

This lab demonstrates a classic case of **Broken Access Control**.

| What Went Wrong | What Should Have Happened |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| App trusted user-supplied `author` field | Server should ignore client-supplied author |
| No session verification on review author | Author should be pulled from session token |
| Any email could be forged in the request | Validate author against authenticated user |

### Prevention

- **Always perform server-side authorization checks** based on the user's session
- **Never trust user-controllable data** for identity or ownership fields
- **Enforce that the author of a review = the currently logged-in user**, not a value passed in the request body
- Use **JWT/session tokens** to determine the author server-side

## Remediation Patch — Broken Access Control (Forged Review)

**OWASP:** A01:2021 — Broken Access Control
**CVE Class:** CWE-639 · Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key

---

### Root Cause

The `/rest/products/:id/reviews` endpoint accepted the `author` field
directly from the request body instead of deriving it from the
authenticated session. Any authenticated user could POST a review under
any email by simply changing one JSON field.

---

### Patch — Node.js / Express (Juice Shop pattern)

#### Before (vulnerable)
```js
// routes/productReviews.js
router.put('/:id/reviews', async (req, res) => {
  const { message, author } = req.body   // ← author trusted from client
  await db.reviews.insert({
    product: req.params.id,
    message,
    author                               // ← attacker controls this
  })
  res.json({ status: 'success' })
})
```

#### After (patched)
```js
// routes/productReviews.js
const { verify } = require('jsonwebtoken')

router.put('/:id/reviews', verifyToken, async (req, res) => {
  const { message } = req.body           // ← only message accepted from body

  // Author is ALWAYS derived from the verified session token — never from input
  const author = req.user.email          // ← set by verifyToken middleware

  await db.reviews.insert({
    product: req.params.id,
    message,
    author
  })
  res.json({ status: 'success' })
})
```

#### `verifyToken` middleware
```js
// middleware/auth.js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')

function verifyToken(req, res, next) {
  const authHeader = req.headers['authorization']
  if (!authHeader) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No token provided' })

  const token = authHeader.split(' ')[1]   // Bearer <token>
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET)
    req.user = decoded                     // { email, id, role, ... }
    next()
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Invalid or expired token' })
  }
}

module.exports = { verifyToken }
```

---

### Patch — Edit existing review (ownership check)

The same flaw applies to PATCH/edit. A user must only be able to edit
their **own** review.

```js
// routes/productReviews.js
router.patch('/:id/reviews/:reviewId', verifyToken, async (req, res) => {
  const review = await db.reviews.findOne({ _id: req.params.reviewId })

  if (!review) return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Review not found' })

  // Ownership check — reject if the review does not belong to this user
  if (review.author !== req.user.email) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden — not your review' })
  }

  await db.reviews.update(
    { _id: req.params.reviewId },
    { $set: { message: req.body.message } }
  )
  res.json({ status: 'updated' })
})
```

## What changed and why

| S.No | Change | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| 1 | `author` removed from accepted request body | Client-supplied identity fields must never be trusted |
| 2 | `author` set from `req.user.email` (JWT payload) | Server derives identity from cryptographically verified token |
| 3 | `verifyToken` middleware added to all review routes | Every mutating request must pass authentication before reaching business logic |
| 4 | Ownership check added to edit route | Authorization must verify the resource belongs to the requester, not just that they are logged in |
| 5 | `process.env.JWT_SECRET` used for signing | Secret never hardcoded — stored in environment config |
