### Iteration 2 — Network
**Goal:** Workstream A complete through A.4 · Architecture proposal in draft

| Outcome | Status |
|---------|--------|

**Key findings confirmed:**
- Cobalt Strike C2 beaconing at ~202s intervals to `37.228.70.134:443`
- Lateral movement via `svcctl` at frame 10799
- Data exfiltration POSTs confirmed via tshark to `36.95.27.243` and `103.102.220.50`
- Second PCAP analysis provided additional corroborating exfiltration evidence

## 02. KEEP — What Worked Well

### Hypothesis-Driven Forensics
Structuring Workstream A around competing hypotheses with explicit confirm/refute/verdict tests prevented premature anchoring. Each hypothesis required a falsification condition — not just confirmation evidence. The lateral movement hypothesis (H3) is the clearest example: high SMB volume to the DC was consistent with normal domain activity and would have been dismissed without the additional requirement to locate `svcctl` calls specifically at frame 10799.

### tshark-Verified Evidence Chain
Every network finding was backed by a reproducible tshark command returning specific frame numbers. Data exfiltration was confirmed across multiple flows with machine-name-embedded URIs — the `/rob87/` and `/tot108/` patterns — providing a complete, reproducible evidence chain. This is the gold standard for network forensics deliverables.

### Modular Repository Structure
Numbering every deliverable folder and file (`A.1`, `A.2`, `B.1`, `B.2`) made the repository navigable without explanation. An independent reviewer could follow the engagement logic from README alone — exactly as the brief required.

### Docker-First Lab Environment
DVWA, Juice Shop, and Metasploitable2 running on isolated Docker ports eliminated environment inconsistencies. The docker-compose was committed from day one and never changed — any reviewer can reproduce the environment in under 15 minutes.

### Semgrep CE — Static Analysis Integration
Running Semgrep CE with the OWASP top-ten ruleset provided a machine-readable before/after diff, converting subjective remediation claims into quantified evidence. The A04 hardcoded JWT finding (1 → 0 findings) and the global scan reduction (169 → 168) are concrete, auditable proof of remediation effectiveness.

### LLM as Force Multiplier — Not Author
LLMs were used to generate candidate payloads, explain protocol bytes, and draft first-pass prose — not to produce final findings. Every LLM output was verified against the running system or primary source before being written into a deliverable.

### Cross-Surface Synthesis
The Joint Threat Model treated Meridian FinServe as one system, not two. Attack Chain 1 traces frame 10799 (`svcctl` lateral movement) through the surface boundary to the IDOR finding on `/api/statements/{id}` — 1,80,000 borrower records exposed via a credential harvested from DC memory. This cross-surface chain is the core deliverable that differentiates this engagement from two separate assessments.

---

## 03. STOP — What to Leave Behind

### Fixed Iteration Boundaries Without Mid-Sprint Adjustment
The engagement was designed around one-week iterations, but mid-sprint scope expansion — particularly adding additional PCAP corroboration in Iteration 2 and extending SAST patch coverage to all three DVWA security levels — pushed work beyond the planned boundaries. Future engagements benefit from a lightweight mid-sprint check to redistribute scope before it accumulates at the end.



---

## 04. START — What to Add Next Time

### Strict Iteration Timetable
A fixed iteration timetable will be defined and followed from day one of the next engagement. Each iteration has a hard exit date, a goal statement, and a scope ceiling. Work that does not fit the current iteration moves to the next backlog, not to an extended sprint. This disciplines scope, improves commit frequency, and ensures deliverables are staged progressively rather than front-loaded at the end.

### RITA — Real Intelligence Threat Analytics
RITA (Real Intelligence Threat Analytics) was in scope as a C2 detection tool but could not be integrated due to time constraints. RITA excels at detecting long-connection beaconing patterns in Zeek/Bro logs — exactly the Cobalt Strike ~202s beacon interval confirmed in H1. In a future engagement, RITA would run alongside tshark to provide a second independent confirmation of C2 beaconing, and its scoring output (`rita show-beacons`) would be a high-value addition to A.4 IOC documentation.

### OWASP ZAP — Automated Web Scanner
OWASP ZAP was available and known but not used due to time constraints in Iteration 3. ZAP's active scan against DVWA and Juice Shop would complement the manual Burp Suite testing by surfacing findings that manual enumeration might miss — particularly in the A07 (authentication) and A04 (insecure design) categories. The ZAP HTML report would also serve as an independent cross-check on the Semgrep CE static findings. Next time, ZAP is run as a first automated pass before manual testing begins, not as an optional addition.

### Cloud and Data Center Security Layer
The Meridian FinServe architecture includes a public cloud footprint and co-located data centers — both in scope for the threat model but not deeply assessed in this engagement. Future iterations should include:
- **AWS/Cloud misconfiguration review** — S3 bucket exposure, IAM role overpermissioning, IMDS v1 access (`169.254.169.254` endpoint — referenced in WS-C findings)
- **Data center network segmentation** — east-west controls between co-located DC and cloud workloads
- **Cloud-native logging** — CloudTrail / VPC Flow Logs as a complement to PCAP analysis for detecting lateral movement and data exfiltration in cloud segments
- **CSPM tooling** — Cloud Security Posture Management to baseline misconfigurations before and after remediation, analogous to what Semgrep CE does at the code layer

This would extend the Defense-in-Depth proposal's coverage from the application and network layers into the infrastructure layer where NBFC-scale data actually resides.

### Architecture Mapping Before Analysis Begins
Draft the Mermaid before/after network segmentation diagrams at the start of Iteration 2, before tshark analysis begins. A pre-drawn architecture map makes anomalous traffic immediately recognisable against a baseline rather than requiring the analyst to construct the baseline and identify the anomaly simultaneously.

### Peer Review Gate on Machine-Readable Artifacts
IOC tables (CSV), SAST results (JSON), and hypothesis verdicts should require one team member to run a verification step before merge — specifically, confirming that every IOC row has a passing tshark filter returning at least one frame from the source PCAP. This is a lightweight gate that catches the highest-consequence errors in the least time.

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| What was found | ✅ All findings documented with request/response evidence |
| Why it is believed | ✅ tshark frame citations · Burp evidence · SAST JSON diffs |
| How it would be fixed | ✅ 5 code patches · 1 config patch · 1 compensating control |
| What trade-offs were considered | ✅ Q4 reflection · Defense-in-Depth effort/cost annotations |
| Environment reproducible <15 min | ✅ docker-compose committed · seed state documented |
| No real PII in any artifact | ✅ All machine names and credentials from public PCAP corpora |

## 08. Three Takeaways

**The finding that mattered most:**
The `svcctl` call at frame 10799 — because until that frame the intrusion looked like a single contained workstation infection, and that one DCE/RPC exchange changed the scope from one host to an entire domain in under 5 microseconds.

**The tool to add next time:**
RITA for automated beacon detection and OWASP ZAP for automated web scanning — both tools were known and available but not used due to time constraints; both would directly strengthen the evidence base in WS-A and WS-B respectively.

**The control with the highest engagement leverage:**
MFA on portal accounts — the single gap at the exact surface boundary between WS-A and WS-B where a network-layer credential becomes a web portal session. Closing it breaks the cross-surface attack chain regardless of how sophisticated the network intrusion was.
